********************************* XPEF Documentation *********************************

Go into the program_code folder and edit the '_ Variables and Libraries.sas' file.
At the very least, make sure the 'xver' variable matches the name of the folder.

If planning to update the estimates, you will need to update the other two variables.
** This could cause errors elsewhere, so test that it works before running. **

If you are going to run a 'reduced capacity' version (scripts 030, 035, 040, 045) be sure to set
new version numbers before running. Otherwise it will overwrite the existing versions.

Once urbansim_lite has been run and you have a new run_id, update that here as well.


** If this is a new xpef version (folder name), you MUST run the following scripts: **
'00. Preparing denormalized MGRA.sas' creates the schema in isam and adds the mgra file.
'01. Preparing DOF Projections Data (age-race-sex).sas' prepares the DOF age/sex/ethnicity projections input file.
'02. Load input data.sas' prepares several other key input files.
The files produced by 01 and 02 shouldn't need to be updated each time, but running these scripts ensures the
inputs are located in the correct place (if they were moved or removed). If they are not, the XPEF will error.

** If you are running a reduced capacity version, you will need to run 030, 035, 040 and 045. **

Next, run urbansim_lite (updating parameters as needed) and then put the run_id into the Variables script.

** Finally, you can run '1010 Control Program.sas' - this will run all the other scripts. **
The model will simulate every year from 2017-2050. Outputs for ABM are written for the following years:
Standard: 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050
Non-Standard: 2023, 2026, 2029, 2032

If these files are all generated at the same time, they will have internal consistency within the synthetic
persons and households files (ie. the synthetic people will match across years and age up appropriately).
If they are not run at the same time, it is much more difficult (I do not know how) to recreate the same 
synthetic persons and households for new years later.

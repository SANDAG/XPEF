# SANDAG SR14 XPEF Process
The XPEF process is the core set of codes and processes used to build SANDAGs Series 14 Forecasts.
The Series 14 Forecasts were developed from 2015-2021, and have a 'base year' of 2016.


## Development
The vast majority of the XPEF structure was created by Dmitry Messen (DME) before he left SANDAG in May, 2019.
He noted before leaving that the last 'complete' version was XPEF09. The last edition he worked on was XPEF11.

Nick Ozanich (NOZ) has made edits or additions as needed to conform to new requests after his departure. 
Rachel Cortes (RCO) has also contributed to improvements or modifications to the jobs allocation and development portions.
Additions and modifications have been noted in the code where they exist, but everything else should be considered the product of Dmitry's work for SANDAG.

## XPEF - eXtended Projections of the Estimates Forecast
The Estimates process developed by DME benchmarked San Diego socioeconomic and demographic traits to observed data gathered by the 2010 Census. 
These data were then carried forward yearly, with adjustments from ACS releases and other available sources of local data.
Although the forecast has a base year of 2016, estimates through 2018 were available and used in the data processes at the time forecasts were generated.
This ability to connect estimates data directly into the forecast lends to the naming convention used.


## Versions and Associations
To the extent possible, input version from other sources are noted within the codes.
Additional information and documentation is available from SANDAG staff.

Originally, the file 'HU Construction and PPH projections.xlsx' was developed to take the DOF projections
being used at the time and create and approximation of housing units needed while also obtaining target
regional headship rates (set to equal 2010 regional headship rates by 2036) and a target vacancy rate of
4.0% by 2040. 

In January 2020, the DOF released dramatically lower population estimates for the region which that file did
not appropriately adjust to (due to several hard-coded elements). The updated version,
'HU Construction and PPH projections_Feb2020.xlsx' was used beginning in XPEF25 to develop new targets.
This new version still uses the headship and vacancy targets originally intended.

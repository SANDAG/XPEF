The files in the main folder (suffix _01) are the original households, persons, and mgra2013_based files.

The files in 'new_parking' (suffix _04 or _04_np) have the new parking assumptions.
* The persons and households files should be the same between _01 and _04. The new parking should only effect the
* mgra2013_based files with the _04_np suffix.

The files in 'do_not_use' are the original new parking mgra2013_based files. They were generated using the original 
new parking logic which was found to have errors in QA review.

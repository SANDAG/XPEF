The files in the main folder (suffix _01) are the original households, persons, and mgra2013_based files.

The files in 'new_parking' (suffix _05 or _05_np) have the new parking assumptions.
* The persons and households files should be the same between _01 and _04. The new parking should only effect the
* mgra2013_based files with the _04_np suffix.

The files in 'do_not_use' are from testing new parking. They were generated using logic which was found to 
have errors in QA review.
